# CookBlock

Another unfinished project when I was trying to make a mobile app by using Xamarin. 

In this app you can create cooking recipes and post it on the database, when other users can save the recipe, give it a rating and send a comment.

This project is working but has some minor bugs. I can remember one, for example. You don't want to make very large photos of your food and post it in the app, because when you'll want to check the recipe it will freeze the app because of a long downloading.

This project was made for android devices. The interface is written in Russian and I'm too lazy to translate it.

This mobile app is a client side of a project. If you want to look at the server side and get the .mdf database file look at the CookBlock.API repository.

P.S.: to connect a mobile application to the API, change the url variable in all files in the service folder.
